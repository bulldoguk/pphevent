Note: This module is in Alpha and not ready for use. It is a community-supported bundle and contributions are welcome!

This bundle is intended to provide event functionality (concerts, recurring webinars, etc.) with <a href="https://apostrophecms.com/">Apostrophe CMS 3</a>. It is based on the `apostrophe-events` bundle for Apostrophe CMS 2.
